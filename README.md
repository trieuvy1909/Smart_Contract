The project runs at localhost, port 3000. All environment variables are defined in the menu.env file. To avoid password scanning exposing the database, I did not push the menu.env file to github.
After pulling the project from github, add the menu.env file to the project's root directory.
There are 2 ways to run the project in debug mode:
1. Visual Studio Code: Run > Start degging
2. Terminal type the following command: "go run main.go"

API documentation, examples, and test cases are documented in the API_Postman_Doc.json file.
